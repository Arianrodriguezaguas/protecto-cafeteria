<h1>Code With Coffee</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>This project that I learned at <a href="https://rodofomori.com.br/devclub">DevClub</a> was created using HTML, CCS and JavaScript. This was a project that I loved because I love coffee and I set myself the goal of improving it by adding components and functions like adding to cart.</h2>
